      Course Policies And Guidelines  
    </td>
    <td width="80%" class="course_desc_detail">
<b><i>Lab participation:</b></i> Lab attendance is required.  

<br/>
<b><i>Coursework Mark Appeals:</b></i> All marks must be appealed <b>within 7 days</b> of the mark being posted.
<br/>
<b><i>Attendance:</b></i> We expect students to attend all lectures and labs. 
It is entirely the students' responsibility to recover any information or announcements presented 
in lectures from which they were absent.
<br/>
<b><i>Electronic devices in labs and lectures:</b></i> No unauthorized <i>audio</i> or <i>video</i> 
recording of lectures is permitted.
<br/>
<b><i>Electronic devices in midterms and exams: </b></i> No electronic devices (e.g. cell phones, 
pagers, PDA, etc.) may be used during examinations or tests <i>unless explicitly authorized</i>.
<br/>
<b><i>Plagiarism:</b></i> These guidelines concern the type of fraud
where a student presents another's work as
his or her own, or allows another to do so.
<UL>
<LI>As fraud invalidates the evaluation of a student's progress,
it is the duty of instructors, teaching assistants,
and laboratory assistants to take measures
to prevent fraud and to be vigilant towards symptoms of fraud.
<LI>Students are encouraged to study together.
But, unless the contrary is indicated, submitted work is to
be done by students individually.  Students are to collaborate
on submitted work only when this is explicitly permitted
by the instructor.  In such a case, the names of
all students who have collaborated on a piece of
submitted work should be indicated on all submitted material.
The collaboration is to involve reasonable effort on the
part of all students involved.  In a situation where this
is clearly not the case, appropriate action
will be taken with regard to those students who have
not fully contributed to the collaborative effort.
<li>
As in all academic endeavour, due credit must be given to
all reference material.  Students should consult the
course instructor if they are not certain which
outside material is appropriate for use in a course.
<LI>In cases where fraud is detected, credit is withheld
from the work affected.  The students involved are
reported to the department chair who may take additional
disciplinary action commensurate with the severity of the
fraud and the past records of the students.
